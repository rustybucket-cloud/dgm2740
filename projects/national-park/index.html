                <p>One of the largest and most charismatic of Grand Canyon National Park's wildlife is the desert bighorn sheep.This species is the largest native animal in the park with males weighing up to 300 lbs (135 kg), though two nonnative species living in the park, bison and elk are larger. Though bighorn are generally associated with mountainous terrain, the unique landscape found in the Grand Canyon provide excellent habitat unlike any other on earth. The canyons have provided remote refuges for these animals and this is the only non-reintroduced population of desert bighorn.</p>
                <div class="hidden more-info">
                    <p>Populations of the desert bighorn sheep declined drastically with European colonization of the American Southwest beginning in the 16th century. These declines were followed by a period of population stabilization ascribed to conservation measures. Desert bighorn sheep numbers remain extremely low, although the overall population trend has increased since 1960.</p>
                    <p>The Desert bighorn sheep population in the Grand Canyon is the only non-re-introduced population of this species, making them important for bighorn conservation efforts across the southwest. Although hunting, grazing, and transplanting do not occur in the park itself, these activities do occur on the park boundaries and can affect park populations. In addition, there are impacts from hikers and tourists who float the river. Some evidence suggests that bighorn, just as elk and deer, will ingest food wrappers, tent plastics, and other human-related items. The ingestion of these materials can cause serious impacts to the digestive system of these animals.</p>

                <p>The California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) is a federally endangered bird that was rescued from extinction by intensive human efforts, it now breeds in the southwest such as Arizona, Utah, and California. Considered one of the rarest birds in the world, it is the largest land bird in North America with a wingspan up to 9 1/2 feet and weighing up to 23 pounds.</p>
                <div class="hidden more-info">
                    <p>California condors have a wingspan of 9.5 feet (3 meters)- at least 2 feet longer than the next largest bird in the region (the golden eagle).
                    Adults are primarily black, but have a brilliant white triangle under each wing and a red or orange head.</p>
                    <p>Juveniles (less than six years old) are almost entirely black, with dark heads and mottled grey plumage on the underside of each wing.
                    Most have obvious number tags on one or both wings identifying the individual.
                    Condors hold their wings directly to the side as they fly. Turkey vultures, which are commonly mistaken for condors, hold their wings in a slight "V" as they fly, with the wingtips pointing slightly upwards.</p>

                <p>Tarantulas grow to a large size- Grand Canyon black tarantulas grow up to 4 inches (10cm) from leg tip to leg tip. The goliath bird-eating spider (Theraphosa blondi) is the world's largest species of tarantula. Found in South America, it can reach up to 11 inches (28cm) from leg tip to leg tip.</p>

                    <p>Tarantula burrows are silk-lined holes in the ground. Tarantulas use silk as a frame to prevent the burrow from collapsing.
                    All tarantulas are covered in thick hair. Grand Canyon black tarantulas are dark in color, and the hair on the abdomen is reddish or orange in color.</p>
